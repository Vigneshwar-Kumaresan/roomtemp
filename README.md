Room Temperature Control using Machine Learning

Nowadays, everyone is looking forward to emerging technologies
which makes their life simple and easy, and they prefer updates which
consumes less time. People find the task is difficult to monitor the weather
and set their room temperature. It will take some time to set the room
temperature. Most of the people wish to save the time and make the task
simpler. If the House product which can control by anywhere will make
people easy to move any place without doubt whether home appliance
switch is On or Off.
So, we can make this task easy by introducing Machine Learning
algorithm to the device. Using Sensor and Microchip can measure the
Temperature of the room and pass the data to cloud. The data analytics and
machine learning algorithms, such as used to predict the regulator value of
the user according to the temperature. It will pass as REST API to the IoT
device which connected to electrical component such as Fan. This would
comfort the user to find the optimal temperature using electrical
component which is connected to IoT.
